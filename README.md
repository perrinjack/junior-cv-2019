## Skills

#### Point 1 Unfinished

During my time at Bank of America, I wrote and distributed a daily newsletter to clients, with market commentary and data analysis. I have continued to develop my written communication skills by [blogging](http://codingwithlaura.wordpress.com) about my experience learning to code and I use it to develop a stronger online presence, by combining it with other social media outlets such as [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wilslau).
I have also taken up coaching at Codebar, a non-profit initiative which runs regular programming workshops.

#### Point 2 Unfinished

From having to organise an end-of-year ball during my final year at university, where the bulk of the organisation coincided with completing finals, to completing group [projects](#projects), I have always thrived when working under pressure. It is my strong organisational and time management skills that I have developed over time that allows me to do this.

#### Fast learner

I earned a full-time offer at Barclaycard by impressing my line manager with how quickly I picked up an understanding of merchant acquiring and the technologies that the team used, despite only being at the company for 8 weeks. For our [Makersbnb](), and [Small Steps] projects, myself and the team decided to leave our comfort zone and learn React, Node,js and Express in the space of 3 weeks without it being in the course curriculum.

#### Point 4 Unfinished.

In my role at Bank of America, I analysed new market data on a daily basis to generate trade ideas. Furthermore, I undertook a project to migrate all of our systems and trade history to a new legal entity. This required careful risk analysis which ensured there was no negative P&L impact on completion.
